### Intention

* One of the board games has been implemented - TicTacToe
* This project incorporated the implementation of SOLID principles

#### Interface Segragation
* Board and BoardGame interfaces were created for keeping this backend design extensible for Chess, SnakeAndLadders, etc board games

### Running 
* Need to run `Main.java` code, rest players can start adding input in the terminal to play the game
* For TicTacToe, player need to provide input in `x,y` where x & y varies from [0,2]
